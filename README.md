# Slash Manager

This is a clean, minimalistic, and easy to use interface for managing slash commands.

# How To Use

1. HIT THIS BUTTON!

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSkillz4Killz%2Fslash-manager&env=APPLICATION_ID,BOT_TOKEN,SECRET_CODE)

## Notes

1.  `BOT_TOKEN`: This is used for authorization header when making requests. This is your bot's token. It will never be used/shared. It is saved under YOUR account when you set it on Vercel with that button.
2.  `SECRET_CODE`: This code will be verified before making any requests. This is useful for allowing only yourself or a few trusted people to manage your commands(devs who don't have access to bot token). No one else will be able to edit your commands without this code. PLEASE MAKE THIS HARD TO GUESS! Remember your website is public, and therefore you don't want just anyone using it.
3.  `APPLICATION_ID`: This is the application id. Normally, this is your bot's id but if your bot is really old this may be different.
