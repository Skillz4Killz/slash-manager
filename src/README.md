# Slash Manager

This is clean, minimalistic, and easy to use interface for managing slash commands.

# How To Use

1. Fork The Repo(Hit that template button!)
2. Add the following to Github Secrets:
   1. `BOT_TOKEN`: This is used for authorization header when making requests.
   2. `SECRET_CODE`: This code will be verified before making any requests. This is useful for allowing only yourself or a few trusted people to manage your commands. No one else will be able to edit your commands without this code. PLEASE MAKE THIS HARD TO GUESS! Remember your website is public, and therefore you don't want just anyone using it.
   3. `APPLICATION_ID`: This is the application id.
3. Trigger the action to rebuild with your secrets installed!
4. Go to your website!
5. Enjoy
